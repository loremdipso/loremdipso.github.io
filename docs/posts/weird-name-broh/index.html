Or, <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ipso%20facto target=_blank>ipso facto</a> maybe?<p>Ah, well, let me take you back to the summer of 1992, when I was born. The story I've been told is that my sister wanted to name me after that kid on the Kix commercial. You know, the one that goes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYEXzx-TINc" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>"Mikey likes it!"</a><sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-1-1><a href=#fn-1>1</a></sup>. Pretty cute, right? Named by my sister, who was only 6 or 7, after a silly cereal commercial.<p>The problem is that Mikey (or Michael, as I was actually named), was <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/decades/names1990s.html target=_blank>by far</a> the most popular boys name in the US in the 90s. And Adams, my surname as well as that of two former presidents<sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-2-1><a href=#fn-2>2</a></sup>, isn't exactly unique.<p>So, here we are, 2020, the age of the machine. I tried valiantly and often, but ultimately every good handle containing any combination of "Michael" and "Adams" had already been thought of and taken. From Twitter to email to web domains, taken. What was I to do?<p>So, I treated my problem like a minimal viable product and just did it as best I knew how in as short a time as possible. Was combining a phrase vaguely related to tech with a latin one that kind of sounded similar to produce a pretty unrecognizable portmanteau the best choice? Probably not. But sometimes the best choice is to make <em>a</em> choice and just move on with your life. The time I could have spent thinking up new names or attempting to buy existing names off their owners is did not promise an adequate ROI.<section class=footnotes><ol class=footnotes-list><li id=fn-1><p>The premise of that commercial is, I think, fundamentally flawed. The other children, dubious about this new cereal, decide to give it to Mikey because he "won't eat it" / "hates everything". What was their goal? If he hates everything then he'll hate it and then they've accomplished nothing. It's like a fever dream, where it kind of seems to make sense until you pick it apart in the ruddy light of day. <a href=#fr-1-1>↩</a></p><li id=fn-2><p>The only repeated surnames among US presidents, so far, are: Adams, Bush, Harrison, Johnson, and Roosevelt <a href=#fr-2-1>↩</a></p></ol></section></div></article><hr><div class=suggested-post-links><h3>Suggested reading</h3><a class=next href=/posts/conception> Up next: <b>Conception</b> </a></div></main></div><footer class="app-footer fade-in"><p>© 2025  Michael Adams  <a href=/rss.xml target=_blank title=rss> <span class=inline-svg> <svg class="feather feather-rss" viewbox="0 0 24 24" fill=none height=24 stroke=currentColor stroke-linecap=round stroke-linejoin=round stroke-width=2 width=24 xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M4 11a9 9 0 0 1 9 9"></path><path d="M4 4a16 16 0 0 1 16 16"></path><circle cx=5 cy=19 r=1></circle></svg> </span> </a></footer></div>
