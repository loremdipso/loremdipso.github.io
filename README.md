# Personal blog for loremdipso.com

Hello! You've found the publish directory for my personal blog. I keep the
pre-build stuff in a private repo and just use this for ease of distribution.
I did that to avoid accidentally leaking some more personal stuff
(email, phone, etc.).

As I write this the blog uses:

- zola for building/templating
- [resume_markdown_to_toml](https://github.com/loremdipso/resume_markdown_to_toml) for my resume
